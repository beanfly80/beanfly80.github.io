## Process
Process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads. 
- A computer program is a sequence or set of instructions in a programming language for a computer to execute.
- PC(Program Counter), Register Set, Process ID, State, ...
- Process isolation is a set of different HW & SW designed to protect each process from other processes on the OS.
 

## Thread
A thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a OS scheduler.
- Program Counter, Register, Stacks, ...

## Build & Run a program

- [Build in C/C++](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3996651/what-is-compiler-linker-loader)
    1. Preprocessor : As the name suggests, it's not part of compilation. They instruct the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. You can call this phase Text Substitution or interpreting special preprocessor directives denoted by #.
    1. Compiler : reads, analyses and translates code into either an object file or a list of error messages. (human understands)source code -> (computer understands)object file.
    1. Assembler : Assemble code gets translated into machine code. You can call assembler a special type of complier.
    1. Linker : combines one or more object files and possible some library code into either some executable, some library or a list of error messages.
    1. Loader : reads the executable code into memory, does some address translation and tries to run the program resulting in a running program or an error message (or both).

- Process in Main memory
    - Stack : local variable, function parameter & temporary data
        - Setups stack-size in compile time.
        - Allocate when a function is called & deallocate when a function is finished.
    - Heap : Allocate/Deallocate dynamic memory in runtime. Slower than stack.
    - Static data : global, static variable
    - Static code : Program code
    - Details 
        - PCB(Process Control Block)
            - Process ID, Schduling state & priority, memory (+ PC, Register set in case of multi-process)
        - TCB(Thread Control Block)
            - TCB exists in each Thread.
            - PC, Register Set, Pointer that indicates PCB


## Inter-process communication(IPC)
- Shared memory
    - Multiple processes are given access to the same block of memory, which creates a shared buffer for the processes to communicate with each other.
- File
    - A record stored on disk, or a record synthesized on demand by a file server, which can be accessed by multiple processes.
- Socket
    - Data sent over a network interface.
- Unix domain socket
    - Similar to an internet socket, but all communication occurs within the kernel.
- Message queue
    - Implemented by the OS, allow multiple processes to read and write to the message queue.
- Anonymous pipe
    - A unidirectional data channel using standard input and output. Data written to the write-end of the pipe is buffered by the operating system until it is read from the read-end of the pipe. Two-way communication between processes can be achieved by using two pipes in opposite "directions".
- Named pipe(also known as a FIFO for its behavior) 
    - A pipe that is treated like a file. Instead of using standard input and output as with an anonymous pipe, processes write to and read from a named pipe, as if it were a regular file.
- Memory-mapped file
    - A file mapped to RAM and can be modified by changing memory addresses directly 
- RPC(Remote Procedure Call)
client–server interaction : request–response message-passing
    - REST(Representational State Transfer) API
    - [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)
        - Net..X improve its performance by using gRPC instead of REST API
        - IDL : [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
            - Generate polyglot(C++, GO, Java, Python, ...) from IDL(Interface Description Language) .proto file
    - cf. https://blog.dreamfactory.com/grpc-vs-rest-how-does-grpc-compare-with-traditional-rest-apis/

### Code review
- [Mojo in Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/51.0.2704.48/docs/mojo_in_chromium.md)
    - The Mojo system API provides a small suite of low-level IPC primitives: message pipes, data pipes, and shared buffers.
    - bindings API : c++, java, JS
    - MessagePipe
    - Using .mojom(IDL for Mojo interfaces)
        ```
        Client -> mojo::Remote<mojom::CertVerifierServiceClient> -- mojo::PendingRemote<mojom::CertVerifierServiceClient>
                                                                        ||
                                                                        ||Pipe
                                                                        ||
                  mojo::Receiver<mojom::CertVerifierService> ------ mojo::PendingReceiver<mojom::CertVerifierService>
        ```

- Webkit IPC Review\
IPC impl. : https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/main/Source/WebKit/Platform/IPC/Connection.h/cpp\
ex.
    ```
    // source\WebKit\UIProcess\WebPageProxy.messages.in
    messages -> WebPageProxy {
        # UI messages
        CreateNewPage( ... ) -> (std::optional<WebCore::PageIdentifier> newPageID, std::optional<WebKit::WebPageCreationParameters> newPageParameters) Synchronous
    }

    // source\WebKit\WebProcess\WebCoreSupport\WebChromeClient.cpp
    Page* WebChromeClient::createWindow(LocalFrame& frame, const WindowFeatures& windowFeatures, const NavigationAction& navigationAction)
    {
        auto sendResult = webProcess.parentProcessConnection()->sendSync(Messages::WebPageProxy::CreateNewPage( ... );
        auto [newPageID, parameters] = sendResult.takeReply();
    }

    // source\WebKit\WebProcess\WebPage\WebPage.messages.in
    messages -> WebPage LegacyReceiver {
        SetInitialFocus(bool forward, bool isKeyboardEventValid, std::optional<WebKit::WebKeyboardEvent> event) -> ()
    }

    // source\WebKit\UIProcess\WebPageProxy.cpp
    class WebPageProxy : public IPC::MessageReceiver, public IPC::MessageSender, .. {};
    void WebPageProxy::setInitialFocus(bool forward, bool isKeyboardEventValid, const std::optional<WebKeyboardEvent>& keyboardEvent, CompletionHandler<void()>&& callbackFunction)
    {
        sendWithAsyncReply(Messages::WebPage::SetInitialFocus(forward, isKeyboardEventValid, keyboardEvent), [callbackFunction = WTFMove(callbackFunction), backgroundActivity = m_process->throttler().backgroundActivity("WebPageProxy::setInitialFocus"_s)] () mutable {
            callbackFunction();
        });
    }
    ```
